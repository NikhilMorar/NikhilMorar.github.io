                The Broad Street cholera outbreak was a severe outbreak of cholera in 1854 near
                Broad Street in the Soho district of the City of Westminster, London, England,
                and occurred during the 1846â€“1860 cholera pandemic happening worldwide. This
                outbreak, which killed 616 people, is best known for the physician John Snow's
                study of its causes and his hypothesis that germ-contaminated water was the source
                of cholera, rather than particles in the air. Snow later used a dot map to
                illustrate how cases of cholera occurred around this pump. Snow's efforts to
                connect cholera incidence with potential geographic sources were based on
                creating what is now known as a Voronoi diagram. He mapped the locations of
                individual water pumps and generated cells that represented all the points on his
                map closest to each pump. The section of Snow's map representing areas in the
                city where the closest available water source was the Broad Street pump included
                the highest incidence of cholera cases.

                This project was based on the original map, by John Snow, to show the clusters
                of cholera deaths (indicated by blue circles) and water pumps in the area
                (indicated by black squares). When viewing this visual, there is a strong
                correlation between cholera deaths to a water pump on Broad Street. Click the

                with narration.
